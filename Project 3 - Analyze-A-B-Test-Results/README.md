# Anaylze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

## Overview

A company has developed a new E-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Prerequisites

You need to install the following libraries


* pandas 
* numpy 
* statsmodel.api 


### Installing

Run the following commands on command prompt.


```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install statsmodel
```

### Statistical Techniques
* Hypothetical Testing
* Logistic Regression
* Correlation Coefficient
* Bootstrapping sampling distribution
* P-value and Z-score calculation


## Conclusion
There was no sufficient evidence found to suggest that the new page converts better than the old one.
