# FordGo Bike Dataset

## Project Overview
This project is divided into two key phases:

In the first phase, I will perform an exploratory data analysis on the *Ford GoBike System* Dataset. Using Python’s data science and visualization libraries, I will explore the dataset’s variables to understand its structure, detect any anomalies, and uncover patterns and relationships. The analysis will progress systematically, beginning with simple univariate relationships and advancing to more complex multivariate relationships.

In the second phase, I will refine my key findings from the exploratory analysis and present them through a polished explanatory analysis. This will involve creating a slide deck that features refined, visually compelling graphics to clearly communicate the results. This phase will heavily rely upon the insights gained from the first part of the project.

## Dataset
#### https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html
The FordGo Bike Dataset includes information about a bike-sharing system. Multiple data files will be joined together to get a full year’s coverage. The features included in the dataset : Start Time and Date , End Time and Date , Start Station ID , Start Station Name , Start Station Latitude , Start Station Longitude , Trip Duration (seconds) , End Station ID , End Station Name , End Station Latitude , End Station Longitude , Bike ID , Member Year of Birth , Member Year of Birth , Member Gender (Male, Female, Other) , User Type (Subscriber or Customer).

## Summary
FortGo Rent-a-Bike system is an incredible idea that is healthy and environmentally friendly. It could be used for both pleasure and business. There are basically two types of users in this system. Subscribers which are in majority **88.6%**, they use it for work and business, that is why their trip durations are **shorter (only 11 minutes)**, whereas Customers who are the minority at **11.4%**, they use it for leisure and fun purposes that's why their trip durations are **much higher (27 minutes)**. Overall in these both types of users, **Females** have the highest trip duration in minutes, which is **31.280**.

## Key Insights from Presentation
In the presentation, I focus on customer habits in 2020. Since the Ford GoBike System currently offers 2 subscribtion types: Customers and Subscribers, I start by introducing the split between those who use the system occasionally (Customers) and those who have a membership (Subscribters). Afterwards, I move to average trip duration (in minutes) of different user groups. There I found out that, Subscribers are more likey to take short trips (11 minutes), while Customers are more likey to take long trips (27 minutes) because Customers use it only for entertainment, and leisure purpose. Afterwards, I use the heatmap to show Duration of Trip (in minutes) of Different Genders and Different Users. From the heatmap the insights extracted are: In Customer group the least trip duration (in minutes) is of Males i.e 25.735, which is quite surprising. In Subscriber group also, the least trip duration (in minutes) is of Male i.e 10.349. Overall, females have the highest trip duration (in minutes) that is 31.280 in both groups.
